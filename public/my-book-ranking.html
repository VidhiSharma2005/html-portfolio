<h1>Absolute Greatest Books Of All Time</h1>
<h2>My Top Book Recs of ALL Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Monster Trilogy</h3>
<h4>-By Rina Kent</h4>
<p>This book was an abasolute joy to read and not just because of my personal bias toward gender bender books and
    movies.
    I am a sucker for that shit and I just can't get enough of it. This book was an absolute treat with well developed
    character with touching backstories and a compelling story. There was tangible and sweet, delicious tension and the
    way that their relationaship developed felt natural, well paced and satisfying. With an appropriate amount of
    betrayals,
    sweet confessions and grovelling, I am in love.<br />
    Rating: 10/10
